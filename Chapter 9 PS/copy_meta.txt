In the quiet fields where grasses sway,
A donkey trots through the sunlit day.
With sturdy hooves and patient eyes,
He watches the world with gentle sighs.

Ears like sails, catching every sound,
From buzzing bees to the breeze around.
His coat, a patchwork of brown and gray,
Carries tales of work and play.

Through dusty paths and cobbled streets,
Carrying burdens, sturdy and neat.
A loyal companion, strong and true,
In fields of green or skies of blue.

With a bray that echoes through the air,
A humble creature beyond compare.
In his simplicity, wisdom lies,
Beneath the vast and open skies.

So hereâ€™s to the donkey, steadfast and kind,
A friend to all, with a gentle mind.

In the rural lands, where farmers toil,
The donkey's presence, loyal and royal.
